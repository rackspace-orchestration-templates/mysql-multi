instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to MySQL, the [Manual](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/index.html)
  documentation will step you through the basics of configuration, connecting,
  user, and  permission management.

  As a part of your server configuration, your server will be configured to run
  nightly backups leveraging
  [Holland](https://github.com/holland-backup/holland#readme).  Backups will be
  stored in the directory /var/lib/mysqlbackups directory on the master node.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Additional Notes
  All write operations should be performed on the Master node. Read operations
  can be performed against any servers in this deployment. By default, all new
  and existing databases will be replicated across the members of this
  deployment.
